			<Text>Earthbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth and rock in all their various forms, prevalent in the Earth Kingdom and the United Republic. Earth is the element of substance, while the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse, strong, and enduring. Following the lion turtles' decision to relinquish their role as protectors of mankind, Oma and Shu were the first earthbenders to learn this art from the badgermoles.</Text>

			<Text>The key to earthbending is utilizing neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to strike and, when that moment comes, acting decisively. In other words, earthbenders generally endure their enemies' attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself. Famous Earthbenders include Toph Beifong, Avatar Kyoshi, Avatar Aang, and Avatar Korra.</Text>

			<Text>Cai, also known as The Cabbage Merchant, was an Earth Kingdom businessman and founder of Cabbage Corp. He is most well known for exclaiming "My Cabbages!" when his cabbage cart was damaged. Originally an ordinary salesman who specialized in selling cabbages, he was constantly plagued by misfortune during his business endeavors, as his cabbages were continually destroyed or damaged after encountering Team Avatar and their enemies. Inspired by an incident at the Earthen Fire Refinery, the cabbage merchant eventually founded Cabbage Corp, a company that mainly produces automobiles and other technologies, sometime before 120 AG.</Text>

			<Text>Cai excessively revered cabbages, to the degree that other people often considered his behavior odd or off-putting. He treated his vegetables with great care and wished for all those around him to also realize how great cabbages were; accordingly, he usually reacted with horror or extreme anger when someone harmed his products. For instance, he would freeze in shock[14] or demand the death sentence for those damaging his business.[11] His repeated bad luck in protecting his cabbages made Cai very paranoid, a trait he kept even after rising to lead a large company.</Text>
