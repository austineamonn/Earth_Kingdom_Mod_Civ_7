			<Text>The Earth Kingdom is one of the world's four nations. Spanning most of a continent as well as several subsidiary islands, it is the largest and most populated sovereignty in the world and encompasses much of the eastern hemisphere. The kingdom operates as a monarchy under the rule of a single Earth Monarch, although the power of its rulers has historically greatly fluctuated.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_EARTH_KINGDOM_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Earth Kingdom was founded after the city state of Ba Sing Se, its later capital, forcibly subjugated several other polities. As a result, the nation is traditionally characterized by significant diversity and divided into quasi-autonomous regions with their own ethnicities, cultures, governments, and laws. It is home to most earthbenders. The people of the Earth Kingdom are proud and strong; they usually adhered to a philosophy of peaceful coexistence and cooperation with the other nations of the world. Originally one of the most powerful empires in the world, the Earth Kingdom experienced a series of crises, civil wars, and political unrest in the 4th and 3rd century BG. This decline was eventually halted, and the Earth Kingdom began to flourish with a long period of internal peace and economic development during the long life of Avatar Kyoshi. However, the constitution that she helped draft was eventually undermined by Earth King Jialun, resulting in an increasingly corrupt and uncaring government as well as the growth of internal tensions. Even though, much of the Earth Kingdom continued to prosper, boasting a large economy, the country began to fall behind in regard to industrialization and technological progress.</Text>

			<Text>From the 1st century BG, the nation was increasingly targeted by the Fire Nation's imperialism, culminating in the Hundred Year War. Outpaced by its aggressive neighbor with regard to military, economy, and technology, the Earth Kingdom suffered terribly during the Great War, but long proved to be the only real obstacle that hindered the Fire Nation from achieving world domination. In 100 AG, the Earth Kingdom mostly fell to a Fire Nation-led coup, though the nation ultimately won the Hundred Year War thanks to Avatar Aang's intervention. The long process of healing followed, and the presence of several Fire Nation colonies led the Earth Kingdom to cede parts of its territory to the newly established United Republic of Nations.</Text>

			<Text>In the following decades, the Earth Kingdom exerted significant international influence and rebuilt, but also experienced a resurgence of the monarch's power. This led to a reactionary and oppressive central government that provoked growing unrest throughout the nation. In 171 AG, the Red Lotus staged an insurrection which resulted in the collapse of the government and plunged the Earth Kingdom into anarchy. The country was stabilized by Kuvira and her army, but she consequently declared an "Earth Empire" under her military dictatorship. The Earth Empire proved short-lived, ending after a failed invasion of the United Republic. Following these events, Earth King Wu decided to gradually abolish the monarchy and Earth Kingdom in favor of separate, democratic states. Despite an attempt to revive the Earth Empire during the Gaoling Crisis, the remnants of Kuvira's regime were defeated once more, with the Earth Kingdom now slowly turning into a democracy.</Text>

			<Text>Earthbending, one of the four elemental bending arts, is the geokinetic ability to manipulate earth and rock in all their various forms, prevalent in the Earth Kingdom and the United Republic. Earth is the element of substance, while the people of the Earth Kingdom are diverse, strong, and enduring. Following the lion turtles' decision to relinquish their role as protectors of mankind, Oma and Shu were the first earthbenders to learn this art from the badgermoles.</Text>
		</Row>
		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_EARTHBENDER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The key to earthbending is utilizing neutral jing, which involves waiting and listening for the right moment to strike and, when that moment comes, acting decisively. In other words, earthbenders generally endure their enemies' attacks until the right opportunity to counterattack reveals itself. Famous Earthbenders include Toph Beifong, Avatar Kyoshi, Avatar Aang, and Avatar Korra.</Text>

			<Text>Cai, also known as The Cabbage Merchant, was an Earth Kingdom businessman and founder of Cabbage Corp. He is most well known for exclaiming "My Cabbages!" when his cabbage cart was damaged. Originally an ordinary salesman who specialized in selling cabbages, he was constantly plagued by misfortune during his business endeavors, as his cabbages were continually destroyed or damaged after encountering Team Avatar and their enemies. Inspired by an incident at the Earthen Fire Refinery, the cabbage merchant eventually founded Cabbage Corp, a company that mainly produces automobiles and other technologies, sometime before 120 AG.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_UNIT_CABBAGE_MERCHANT_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Cai excessively revered cabbages, to the degree that other people often considered his behavior odd or off-putting. He treated his vegetables with great care and wished for all those around him to also realize how great cabbages were; accordingly, he usually reacted with horror or extreme anger when someone harmed his products. For instance, he would freeze in shock[14] or demand the death sentence for those damaging his business.[11] His repeated bad luck in protecting his cabbages made Cai very paranoid, a trait he kept even after rising to lead a large company.</Text>

			<Text>The Earth Kingdom Royal Palace is the home of the Earth Monarch and the seat of the Earth Kingdom's government. Located within the Upper Ring at the center of Ba Sing Se, the palace and surrounding grounds served as the spiritual and political center of the entire Earth Kingdom until it fell to the Fire Nation in 100 AG and later to the Red Lotus in 171 AG. The palace is a superb example of traditional Earth Kingdom architecture and its massive scale makes it unlike anything else in the world.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_WONDER_EARTH_MONARCH_PALACE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The Royal Palace is almost certainly the largest palace compound in the world; with its myriad towers, gardens, shrines, courts, and plazas, it is very nearly a city in itself.[12] The palace was designed so that it was located at the figurative heart of Ba Sing Se, and by extension the Earth Kingdom. It is surrounded on all sides by the Upper Ring, home to the central government ministries and the mansions of the city's wealthiest citizens, bureaucrats, and civil servants. The palace is arranged on a north-south axis which extends beyond its walls to form the central axis of the Upper Ring.</Text>

			<Text>For centuries, Ba Sing Se was believed unassailable due to its extensive fortifications. Regardless, the military of the Fire Nation prepared for a possible war with the Earth Kingdom as early as the 4th century BG. The Hundred Year War between the Fire Nation and the rest of the world eventually erupted in 0 AG. Over the course of several decades, the Fire Nation's armies gradually conquered much of the Earth Kingdom, and eventually launched a campaign to capture Ba Sing Se under General Iroh, Crown Prince of the Fire Nation. His hope was that, by conquering the mightiest city in the Earth Kingdom, he could finally secure victory for the Fire Nation.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_EARTH_KINGDOM_SIEGE_OF_BA_SING_SE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>Around 94 AG, General Iroh and several armies under his command besieged the Earth Kingdom capital of Ba Sing Se. The siege was initiated after Fire Nation infantry began attacking the Outer Wall of the city, hoping to breach the walls in order to secure a path for an invasion. The defending earthbenders of Ba Sing Se fought back, managing to hold them off for a long period of time. The turning point of the siege came when General Iroh finally breached the Outer Wall during a massive artillery bombardment of trebuchets. Despite their defeat at the Outer Wall, Ba Sing Se's garrison kept up a desperate defense of the city, and continued to inflict heavy losses on the Fire Army. General Iroh's morale was crushed upon learning of his son Lu Ten's demise fighting in the Siege. Heartbroken and demoralized, Iroh lost his will to fight. He realized that there was no end in sight for the siege, as the Earth Kingdom defenders remained resolutely unwilling to surrender. Furthermore, his armies had taken very heavy losses and their morale was wavering. The general consequently ordered his troops to withdraw from the battle.</Text>

			<Text>The Conspiracy of Ba Sing Se was a ploy orchestrated by Long Feng and the Dai Li to control the Earth Kingdom capital, Ba Sing Se, by appropriating sovereignty from Earth King Kuei. Long Feng executed this by covering up the Hundred Year War and slowly establishing jurisdiction over the affairs of the city. The Dai Li forbade citizens from talking about the Hundred Year War inside the walls, or they would be imprisoned or brainwashed. This ensured that the city would not erupt into chaos. The government kept high-profile arrivals and visitors in line by creating the Cultural Ambassadors, a group of brainwashed women all named "Joo Dee" who were assigned to important individuals as guides. The Joo Dees constantly reminded their guests of precise government policy in a cheery and enthusiastic manner. The government also actively supported criminal gangs to keep the city's commoners in line and make sure they followed the new rules without question.</Text>

			<Text>Any protests related to the war, such as demands of support for refugees, were swiftly suppressed. Certain topics such as the culture of the Air Nomads were also discouraged from discussion, as it was hard to talk about the Air Nomads in general without speaking of their demise in the war after decades of their disappearance. While the city continued to accept refugees from the rest of the Earth Kingdom, they had to call themselves "newcomers" and were quickly kept in line by the gangs. The conspiracy was eventually exposed by Team Avatar, and Long Feng was subsequently imprisoned. The conspiracy directly caused the Coup of Ba Sing Se when Long Feng attempted to regain control of the metropolis by negotiating with Azula.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_EARTH_KINGDOM_LONG_LOST_LOVE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_1">
			<Text>An ancient Earth Kingdom legend states that a man named Shu and a woman named Oma, each from one of two warring towns, met atop a mountain that divided their peoples and fell deeply in love. Although their relationship was forbidden and it was dangerous for them to continue meeting, the couple found a way to continue seeing each other in secrecy. By observing the badgermoles, the couple learned how to earthbend. Using their new powers, they created a great labyrinth which only they could navigate. This allowed them to meet secretly, while anyone else who tried to follow them would become lost forever in the ever-shifting tunnels</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_EARTH_KINGDOM_LONG_LOST_LOVE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The couple's romance ended in tragedy when Shu was slain in the war between their two villages. Oma, stricken with grief and sorrow, performed a terrifying display of earthbending power that could have easily destroyed both villages. Instead, she declared the conflict over and demanded that the two villages live in peace. The warring villages joined together and built a new city to honor the couple's love. This city eventually grew into Omashu, the name being derived from the combination of their two names. The short epitaph found on the lovers' tombs deep within the cave reads only "Love is brightest in the dark".</Text>

			<Text>Ba Sing Se is the capital of the Earth Kingdom as well as one of its constituent states, encompassing a large portion of the nation's northeastern corner. After the Surrender of Omashu, the city became the last great Earth Kingdom stronghold during the Hundred Year War.</Text>

		<Row Tag="LOC_PEDIA_PAGE_NODE_CIVIC_MO_EARTH_KINGDOM_THE_IMPENETRABLE_CITY_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2">
			<Text>The city is by far the largest in the world, essentially being more of a small country than a mere city. As a testament to its grandeur, the Earth Kingdom's roadway network is centered on the city.Ba Sing Se means "Impenetrable City"; it is so named for its world-famous walls, the gates of which have no hinges or other hardware and are opened by the use of earthbending. Within the Outer Wall lies a large expanse of farmland, Lake Laogai, and several mountains. The Inner Wall encloses the city itself. The metropolis is also notable for having a unique system of walls dividing the populace into different parts of the city based on social status</Text>

			<Text>Ba Sing Se was the safest place for refugees displaced by the Hundred Year War because of the Fire Nation's failure to penetrate its walls. One of the main reasons it stood strong during the Hundred Year War was that the city relied on itself. However, it was eventually captured by the Fire Nation after Princess Azula's play in the Coup of Ba Sing Se. The city was later liberated by the Order of the White Lotus in the final battle of the War. In 171 AG, however, Ba Sing Se fell again, this time to anarchy after the Red Lotus, led by Zaheer, assassinated the Earth Queen. A few weeks later, the situation in the metropolis had been stabilized by Kuvira and her army, which led to her being appointed by the world leaders as the temporary head of the kingdom. Wu was later reinstated as the Earth King after the failed invasion of the United Republic of Nations and Kuvira's surrender.</Text>
