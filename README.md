### Unique Narrative Events:

4 Unique Narrative Events with more on the way!

## Current Issues:

<ol>
    <li>Wonder shows as the Pyramids.</li>
    <li>No visual model for the Outer Wall Unique Improvement.</li>
    <li>No Audio for unique civic and wonder quotes.</li>
    <li>Not all bonuses are shown with leonardfactory's policy yield preview mod, specifically the 0 food maintenance causes some issues for policies that impact specialist food cost showing them adding food when they are not. The two are still compatible and having both will not impact gameplay, the only impact is this visual bug.</li>
    <li>Some Narrative Events are unable to activate.</li>
</ol>

## Latest Update:

Reworked unique civic tree bonuses. Changed Construction Mandate Policy to Excessive Tax. Overall, shifted identity of Civ to give a unique playstyle focused on getting Wars declared on you. Updated Unit costs to match update 1.2.5.
